## Application Summary
This is a console application that uses a public api (ToDoApi) to get all the ToDo items. getting was built using ASP.NET Core with razor pages. I wanted to sharpen my skills with razor pages and my skills of using outside data to build a web application. I wanted to have fun with this project so I combined both my hobbies (sports and coding) into one and this is what came out of that.
